                Welcome to this brand new website that we (Marty & Ymke) just created for no reason! Although you have to admit that the
                style is pretty fancy, we really didnt have any plans for what couple actually be on here, that means that
                you can have fun reading whatever we decide to post here :). We really don't know what is going to be on
                here soooo... You know. Have fun I guess.

                So guess what, I recently found out that cats are pretty awesome. I have known this for all my life but I just decided to
                post on here to fill up this amazing cube. Reading this text may or may not seem like a waste of time but
                I can assure you, it totally is. You might aswell stop reading right now! But we both know that you are curious
                to keep reading and really want to know if there truly is no useful content within this box. So what is it
                you're looking for? Money? Fame? We don't have either of those things in this virtual box, especially because
                fame is not something physical that we can simply put in one of these. We could put some money in there,
                however we don't seem to have any right now... Please come back at a later time and we may (or may not) have
                some money for you.
